# Applications

Applications is an experimental plugin that allows players to submit applications. Players can complete applications in-game which is initially filtered and then, if passing filtering, sent to be manually reviewed. The goal of this plugin is to create an objective system that lessens the burden of staff labor.

It's currently purposed exclusively for CiviCraft staff applications, but the intention is to make it usable for all servers and for more than staff applications down-the-line. Priority is for CiviCraft, though. You are welcome to take what I've done and make it work for your server, though!

## How It Works
1. Player submits an application.
2. Application is judged based on pre-configured requirements.
   - Unsuccessful applications are automatically rejected *with reason!*
   - Passing applications move on to next phase.
3. Application is sent to staff in-game and through discord for manual review.
4. Staff reviews and make final decision.
